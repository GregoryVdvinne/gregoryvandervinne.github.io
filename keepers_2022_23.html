<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As a game that is very fluid and has few scoring plays, football
(soccer) is not a game in which you frequently hear fans quoting a lot
of statistics other than perhaps an attacker’s goals and assists. As
somebody who analyzes data for a living and plays/watches football as a
hobby, I recently became interested in taking a closer look at some of
the free football-related data available online. I decided that
goalkeeping stats would be a good place to start for two reasons. First,
goalkeeping stats are among the most telling statistics available.
Second, I have played goalkeeper nearly my entire life.</p>
<p>In this post we will look at which keepers were in the best form last
season and which keepers have been performing well over the past three
seasons. I give some thoughts on what we can really learns from these
statistics, which keepers stand out to me, and which keepers might be
ones to watch for the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="technical-notes" class="section level2">
<h2>Technical Notes</h2>
<p>The data are based only on league matches. In the information
displayed when hovering your mouse over a data point, a few keepers may
be shown to be playing for a club they played for previously, and some
keepers may be one year younger than they currently are. This has to do
with the fact that these data are from past seasons. While I could have
remedied this, I didn’t think it was worth the time given that I am
doing this simply for enjoyment. The actual statistics are accurate.
Regarding the plots, this is my first foray into using Plotly (instead
of ggplot2) for plotting in R. Please forgive me for any imperfections
in the figure aesthetics.</p>
</div>
<div id="shot-stopping" class="section level2">
<h2>Shot Stopping</h2>
<p>We will start by looking at what everyone thinks of when they think
of goalkeeping: shot stopping. Though there are several different
statistics that attempt to measure how effectively a keeper stops shots,
post-shot goals saved above expected, or PSGSAx, and similar statistics
derived from it, are by far the best statistics available to us. PSGSAx
might sound complicated but it is really not. PSGSAx is the number of
saves a keeper made minus the number of post-shot expected goals (PSxG)
they faced. Each time a goalkeeper faces a shot on target, that shot is
assigned a PSxG value. The PSxG value represents the percentage of the
time that we would expect a given shot to go in the net given where on
the field the shot was taken from and the trajectory of the shot. So a
shot taken from ten yards out from the middle of the goal traveling
toward the top corner would have a PSxG value near one, while a shot
that rolls along the ground toward the middle of the goal from 30 yards
out would have a PSxG value near 0. An example of how this effects a
goalkeeper’s PSGSAx is that if a keeper saves a shot with a post-shot
expected goal value of 0.75, their PSGSAx will increase by 0.75.
However, if they concede the goal, their PSGSAx will decrease by 1 minus
0.75, or 0.25. Therefore, PSGSAx can be positive or negative. A
perfectly average keeper should have a PSGSAx of 0.</p>
<p>In the below plots I show PSGSAx on the Y axis and PSGSAx divided by
the number of post-shot expected goals a keeper faced on the X axis.
Essentially, the x-axis helps account for the fact that keepers who face
very few shots have fewer opportunists to increase or decrease there
gross PSGSAx. Therefore, I consider the x-axis a slightly better measure
than the Y axis but having both help one to understand context. I
believe that these stats are <em>much</em> more telling regarding a
keeper’s shot-stopping abilities than clean sheets or simple save
percentage, which I, among others, believe are hardly telling at all.
See, for example <a
href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/soccer-analytics-hugo-lloris-save-percentage-goalkeepers-premier-league/"
class="uri">https://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/soccer-analytics-hugo-lloris-save-percentage-goalkeepers-premier-league/</a>.</p>
<p>Before continuing, it is important to note that while I think these
stats do tell us something about keepers’ performances and help us to
understand the quality of keepers they do not tell the full story. For
example, PSGSAx doesn’t account for where defenders are on the field
when a shot is taken.</p>

<p>To be included in the charts for the 2022-23 season alone, keepers
must have participated in at least 15 league matches in the season. To
be included in the charts for the last three seasons combined, keepers
must have played in at least two out of the three seasons and they must
have played a total of at least 38 matches.</p>
<p>Looking at the data, there are few unsurprising keepers who stand
out, and a few rather surprising ones who stand out as well. It is clear
that, as most readers probably already thought without seeing stats,
Allison and Ter Stegen had fantastic seasons last season, while Allison,
Maignan, and Courtois have been among the best shot-stoppers in Europe
over the past three seasons combined. As someone who has rated Bernd
Leno very highly since his early days at Bayer Leverkusen, I also can’t
help but point out that he, too, stands out in both charts. Kepa’s
relative success stopping shots over the past three seasons may come as
a surprise to some but he has played only about one season worth of
league matches in that time. Perhaps the most surprising is Edgar Badia
of Elche, who had the highest PSGSAx over the last three seasons across
the top five leagues. He did benefit from facing a lot of shots while
playing for a relegation-battling Elche side though. When you take the
number of post-shot expected goals faced into account, he is slightly
less exceptional.</p>
<p>I have coloured the points by age category to make it easier to spot
young goalkeepers who might be ones to watch for the future. Among the
young keepers, Alban Lafont has been very strong over the last few
seasons. Unsurprisingly, Donnarumma and Koebel also look strong, while
Mamardashvili has been above average despite being one of the very
youngest starting keepers in Europe. When it comes to just last season,
Yehvanne Diouf’s performance jumps off the page. His debut season in
2022-23 was incredible, and from reading some articles, he looked nearly
as good in-person as good as his stats look on paper. One season,
however, is a small sample size. I expect some regression to the mean
from him this year but he is one to watch nonetheless.</p>

<div id="intercepting-crosses" class="section level2">
<h2>Intercepting Crosses</h2>
<p>To gauge how keepers have faired at defending crosses, I look at two
very similar stats. On the y-axis I show total crosses intercepted,
while on the x-axis I show percentage of crosses intercepted. I don’t
believe that these simple stats gauge a keeper’s ability to defend
crosses as well as PSGSAx gauges a keeper’s ability to stop shots. These
stats ignore context. Some keepers might face crosses that are more
difficult to defend than other keepers. This is likely to be the result
of the way the team in front of them defends, the way teams in their
league play, or a number of other reasons. However, I do believe that
these stats can tell us a little bit, or at the very least, be
interesting to look at.</p>

<p>First, Emiliano Martinez is outstanding. He is clearly both very
aggressive and very successful when it comes to intercepting crosses.
Among younger keepers, Lafont looks quite strong still and, as with
shot-stopping, Yehvanne Diouf looked exceptional last season.</p>

<h2>Sweeper Keeping</h2>
<p>Next I thought I’d look at sweeping. Gauging which keepers are the
best sweepers, that is, the best at coming out to deal with through
balls, is a difficult task. Below I show two highly correlated stats
plotted against each other. The stats are average distance from goal of
all defensive actions, and the number of actions each keeper takes
outside of their penalty area per 90 minutes. While quite interesting, I
am not confident that these stats are really great indicators of how
good a keeper actually is at sweeping. The amount a keeper comes out to
sweep up probably has a lot to do with how high of a defensive line his
team plays with and how much defending his team do. Additionally,
knowing that a keeper comes out of his box a lot doesn’t tell us how
successful he is in those attempts. Still, one would expect that if a
keeper came out and failed to win the ball a lot, he would either be
replaced or forced to change his ways.</p>

<p>Clearly, the two Manuels - Neuer and Riemann - are outlines. Alisson
is also makes a lot of plays relatively far up the pitch. Unlike in the
previous charts, Lafont and Diouf are not outstanding. Beyond
interesting individual players, I also noticed an interesting pattern
between leagues in these charts. It appears to me that Bundesliga
keepers on the whole are much more aggressive than keepers in other
leagues. I have since explored that pattern and found that it is true,
and not just because of Neuer and Riemann.</p>

<div id="long-ball-passing" class="section level2">
<h2>Long-Ball Passing</h2>
<p>Lastly, we take a look at keepers’ success in playing long balls. A
long ball here is defined as a ball played further than 40 yards. I show
both the number of long balls played per game and the percentage of long
balls completed to teammates successfully. The number of long balls
played per game by itself is not a measure of a keepers’ long passing
ability but a keeper who plays a lot of long balls at a high success
rate is probably good at playing long balls. At this point I might be
beating a dead horse, but these stats are far from perfect for judging a
keeper’s ability to play long passes. The team and manager a keeper
plays for probably have a large impact on both of these stats.</p>

<p>Once again, Manuel Riemann proves to be a total outlier. Altogether,
he is one of the most fascinating keepers in these graphs. I would love
to hear from some Bochum fans about what is going on with him.
Meanwhile, Yehvanne Diouf stood out in this respect as well last season.
Some familiar names have high long ball completion percentages also. Ter
Stegen and Neuer have the highest and second-highest completion
percentages, respectively, over the past three seasons, while
Handanovic, Szczesney, and Ederson all rank highly as well. Manchester
City’s other keeper, Stefan Ortega has a very high completion percentage
on a large volume of passes in addition to looking good in the other
graphs also. It is surprising to me that he is satisfied with being a
backup keeper given how strong he looked for Arminia Bielefeld.</p>
